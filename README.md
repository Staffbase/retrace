RE-Trace makes journaling fast while staying out of your way. No cluttered UI, no long click paths to create your new entry. Just hit the shortcur (`CMD + L` on Mac, `Ctrl + L` on Windows and Linux), enter what's on your mind, hit `Enter` and you're done.

In the evening, make sure to take a deep breath and recap your day.
