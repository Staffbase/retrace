RE-Trace makes journaling fast while staying out of your way. No cluttered UI, no long click paths to create your new entry. Just hit the shortcut (<kbd>âŒ˜ CMD</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd> on Mac, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>L</kbd> on Windows and Linux), enter what's on your mind, hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> and you're done.

In the evening, make sure to take a deep breath and recap your day.
